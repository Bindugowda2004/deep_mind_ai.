# Deep Mind AI — Shunya Hackathon Project

Welcome to our submission for the **Shunya Hackathon**, titled **Deep Mind AI**. This project explores intelligent data analysis and visualization using Python, focusing on meaningful insights through research-based modeling and practical implementations.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This repository contains several Python scripts demonstrating different aspects of our project:

- 🔎 `research.py`: Collects and processes relevant research data.
- 📊 `visualization.py`: Generates insightful plots and visual analytics.
- 📈 `percentile.py`: Computes percentile-based metrics for evaluation.
- 🧩 `integrating.py`: Integrates all modules and applies the final model.
- 🧮 `summary.py`: Summarizes the overall output and interpretation.
- 🛍 `ecommerce.py` *(if applicable)*: Sample use case for product recommendation or analysis.
